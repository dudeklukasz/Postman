## API Testing with Postman 
As part of my QA journey, I’ve built strong skills in **REST API testing** using Postman. This tool has been my go-to for validating functionality, exploring API behaviors, and uncovering defects that could impact real users. By combining technical knowledge with practical testing techniques, I’ve gained confidence in ensuring APIs are both reliable and user-friendly.  

### Key Skills in Postman:  
- Testing REST APIs using HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`)  
- Creating and organizing collections for structured testing  
- Using environment and global variables for flexible requests  
- Building **chained requests** to simulate real-world workflows  
- Writing **assertions in JavaScript** to verify responses automatically  
- Generating and sharing test reports

### Hands-On Experience with Public APIs  
To practice in real-world scenarios, I tested several public APIs:  

- **Restful-Booker** → [API documentation](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc)
- **Czy IT jest dla mnie** → [API documentation](https://testing-platform.czyitjestdlamnie.pl/api/swagger-api-demo)
- **Trello API** → [API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-actions/#api-group-actions)
